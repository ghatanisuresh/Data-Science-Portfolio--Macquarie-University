# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the files for the four Portfolio tasks for COMP2200/6200 in Semester 1 2022. 


Portfolio 1: Analysis of MovieLens Data

This notebook contains MovieLens data and performs some basic different operation on this dataset for exploring visualization on key variables and finding out the relationships along with analysis and correlations between different variables. Below are the some operations perform on this data set : 
   * Removed Missing data from datasets
   * Descriptive Statistics:  the total number, mean, std, min and max regarding all rating records
   * Plotting and Analysis
   * Detect and remove outliers


Portfolio 2: 

<br> Prediction of users' ratings towards movies using Linear Regression Model on same MovieLens dataset from the Portfolio 1, and measure the model performance by exploring different sizes of training/testing data with feature selection. It cosists of below steps, And Visualize, Compare and Analyze the Results finally.

* Data Exploration
* Building Models
* Making predictions, and
* Result Evaluation
   

Portfolio 3: Predict the value of the feedback

<br>This portfolio consists of the same kind of previous dataset "movielens", with a little bit different from the previous dataset "MovieLens" of the previous Portfolio tasks, where the column 'rating' is replaced by the 'feedback' column containing two binary values: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 indicates the user likes the corresponding movie. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 indicates the userd dislikes corresponding movie. 
<br>The purpose of portfolio 3 is to build and evaluate predictive models for feedback from available features.


Portfolio 4: Build a various machine model, compare and choose the best one. 

<br> In this portfolio, notebook consists of the stroke dataset. Based on input criteria such as gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status, I use this dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke or not. 

<br> I performed various regression and classification model, such as Simple Linear Regression model, Logistic Regression Model, K-Nearest Model, and Based on input criteria such as gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status, I use this dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke or not. Therefore, I performed various regression and classification model.
